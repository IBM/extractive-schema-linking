# extractive-schema-linking
This code implements a model for schema linking for text-to-SQL. Schema linking identifies the subset of the database schema that is needed to construct the SQL query to answer the user's information need. We use an extractive approach, predicting probabilities for each input schema element. This permits a recall oriented approach.
